Hello, my name is Tayfun. I'm living in Eskisehir, Turkey. I have 10+ years experience about web development. I took "jeet kune-do" lessons long time ago.

I have 2 project and 1 youtube channel to share my knowledge.

#### frontendaily.com
Everyday (or every 2 || 3 days) I'm sharing a new HTML-CSS sample with video tutorial.

#### prototurk.com
I'm sharing everything what I know about development. Also there is QA and dictionary.

#### PROTOTURK (youtube channel)
Since 2012, I'm  trying to help people.
